<p>PT 617</p>
<p>As designed, the PT boat's primary mission was for advanced base operations in foreign countries, and to defend coastal waters from capital ships, but additional missions were assumed throughout the course of World War II.</p>
<p>The Higgins and Elco Boat companies built a majority of United States PT Boats. Designs varied, but these boats were generally 80' in length and carried a beam (width) of 20'. Typical armaments included four torpedoes and an assortment of 40 mm, 37 mm, 20 mm, and .50 caliber machine guns, depth charges, and rocket launchers. Three Packard Marine gasoline engines powered the boats to a top speed of 45 knots.</p>
<p>At the end of World War II, the expense of returning PT boats to the United States from overseas was considered prohibitive, so most boats were stripped of useful materials and burned. Despite the paucity of remaining boats, and the dwindling number of surviving PT veterans, these legendary vessels continue to captivate the imagination of history enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
<p>PT 617, an Elco (Naval Division of Electric Boat Company) boat nicknamed "Dragon Lady" missed World War II, but served as a training vessel and a diving platform in Florida. PT Boats, Inc., the national organization of PT veterans, acquired her in extremely poor condition and restored her over five years in Melville, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The same type of vessel piloted by President John Kennedy, PT 617 was towed to Battleship Cove in 1986 and placed on display with PT 796. Collectively, these two vessels and the National PT Museum on board Battleship Massachusetts represent the world's largest collection of PT artifacts and memorabilia.</p>
<p>PT 617 is the only example of an Elco-built PT boat on display in the world.</p>
<p>Both PT 617 and PT 796 are National Historic Landmarks.</p>
<p>As home to the National PT Boat Museum, Battleship Cove displays the world's largest collection of PT boat artifacts and memorabilia. The PT Boats are complemented by a vast assemblage of ephemera collected by WWII PT boaters in the Pacific and Atlantic theaters, artifacts that help us to appreciate not only the heritage of PT boaters but also the diverse cultures (Japanese, German, Italian, French, and British) of the regions from which these items were drawn.</p>
